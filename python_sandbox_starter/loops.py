# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

people = ['John', 'Paul', 'Sara']

# for person in people: 
#  print(f'Person: {person}')
# for i in range(len(people)): 
#     print(f'Number: {i}')
    
for i in range(0, 11): 
    print(f'Numers: {i}')
# While loops execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
